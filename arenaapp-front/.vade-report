Implemented Vercel Web Analytics integration for Next.js

SUMMARY:
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the arenaapp-front Next.js project using the App Router architecture.

CHANGES MADE:

1. Installed @vercel/analytics package
   - Package version: ^1.6.1
   - Used npm (project's package manager based on package-lock.json)
   - Updated package.json and package-lock.json

2. Modified src/app/layout.tsx
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the existing SpeedInsights component
   - Placed after {children} and other components as recommended
   - Maintained existing code structure and imports

FILES MODIFIED:
- package.json: Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- package-lock.json: Updated with new dependency and its transitive dependencies
- src/app/layout.tsx: Added Analytics import and component

BUILD VERIFICATION:
✓ Project builds successfully with Next.js 16.0.7
✓ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
✓ All routes compile correctly
✓ No new linting errors introduced by Analytics integration
✓ Existing codebase linting issues remain unchanged (pre-existing)

NOTES:
- This is an App Router project (using /src/app directory structure)
- The project already has SpeedInsights from Vercel, so adding Analytics complements the existing monitoring setup
- Analytics component is placed alongside SpeedInsights in the root layout for consistency
- The implementation follows Next.js best practices for App Router integration
- All dependencies properly installed and locked in package-lock.json
